    <p style="width: 50%;">An old name for espresso (1940s and 1950s). 
        A long espresso drink served primarily in Germany, 
        Switzerland and Austria and northern Italy (1980s onwards), 
        along the Italian/Swiss and Italian/Austrian border.

    <h2>Frensh Roast</h2>
    <img src="./Images/french-roast.jpeg" alt="Frensh Roast">
    <p style="width: 50%;">Dark roasts, light roasts,
        medium roasts, oh my! These are things we can understand, 
        right? Then why do those punk roasters have to go and throw extra categories in there, 
        like French roast? When I hear French roast, 
        I think, “Okay, a darker roast…” and that’s it. But that can’t be it, right? 
        There has to be more! </p>

    <!--Colobian Roast-->

    <h2>Colobian Roast</h2>
        <img src="./Images/columbian-roast.jpeg" alt="Colobian Roast">
        <p style="width: 50%;">Our organic Colombian coffee comes in both dark and medium roasts. 
        It is full-bodied with tones of citrus and ripe fruit, with the dark roast offering a rich bittersweetness. 
        Our Loring coffee roaster employs clean roasting technology which enhances this coffee’s subtleties.
        Our beans come from the Huila department of Colombia, a region of small coffee farms in the shadow of the Nevado del Huila volcano. 
        Rich volcanic soil combined with optimal climate and altitude are the necessary elements for growing excellent coffee. 
        This cooperative of small farms grows mostly caturra and colombia varietals, which are pulped, fermented for 24 hours, 
        and fully washed resulting in a smooth complex cup.</p>
